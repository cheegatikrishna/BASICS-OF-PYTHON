'''''sequence data type:tuple data type and its methods'''
#tuple is a collection of data type which can store the any data type
#it is represented as paranthesis '()'
#tuble is a imutable
#it allows the duplicate values and also allows slicing method

#examples
a=(1,2.3,"krishna",True,1+0j,10)
print(a.count(10))  #it is used to find the count of specifed element in a tuple

print(len(a)) #length of the tuple

b=(1.3,3.4,2)
print(a+b) #concate of two tuples (it will add end of the tuple)

print(a.index(10)) #to find the index position of a specified element in a tple

print(a[1:4:2]) #slicing is helps to print the particular elements in a tuple
print(a[::-1]) #to print the reverse of elments in a tuple
